to build web with dependencies use
`pip freeze > requirements.txt` command

Then create repo on GitHub and push the project

to deploy run the app-server
`streamlit run web.py`
open the page and in hamburger-menu select "Deploy this app"
and it will open the https://share.streamlit.io/ page

if you are not authorised  or this site is not authorised in your GitHub signin and authorise
than select the correct repo, branch and press "Deploy" button

in my case it passed me to this page when Deployed
https://stadeleon-python-web-tasklist-web-69sh7i.streamlit.app/
